# Jev as an Intaris evaluator

**Status (2026-09-25): implemented, benchmarked, opt-in; not recommended as
the production default.** Intaris continues to use the Groq-backed
`gpt-oss-20b` L1 evaluator in its cost/performance-oriented deployment. The
Jev results below do not justify replacing it yet.

Jev is a hosted TypeSafe *System One* model for bounded questions, not a
generative LLM. It returns probabilities for yes/no and multiple-choice
answers; it does not generate explanations or summaries. Intaris can use it
for first-level (L1) tool-call alignment/risk evaluation and parent/child
intention alignment. Intention generation, the judge, L2 summaries, L3
analysis, and independent benchmark scoring still require conventional LLMs.
The evaluator backend is selected with `EVALUATOR_BACKEND`; `llm` remains the
default. See [configuration](configuration.md#tool-call-evaluator) for the
TypeSafe and OpenRouter endpoints and required credentials.

## Why consider it?

| | Jev via OpenRouter | Groq-backed `gpt-oss-20b` |
|---|---|---|
| Strength | Fast typed classifications and per-answer probabilities | Better observed balance of threat detection and benign-call approval; generative explanations |
| Limitation | No generated rationale; sensitivity to question design and confidence thresholds; additional hosted-provider/data-handling dependency | Slower L1 calls in this experiment; output-token charge |
| L1 P95 latency, sampled showcase | 430 ms original; 439 ms optimized | 791 ms |
| Cost | $0.042/million Jev input tokens at the rate used for this experiment | $0.075/million uncached input, $0.037/million cached input, $0.30/million output (deployment pricing) |

The L1 timing is for evaluated calls, not every API response. Fast-path calls
bypass both models. Groq's cached-input rate is **lower** than Jev's input
rate; actual cost depends on prompt sizes, cache hits, output tokens, and any
provider fees. We measured 1,096,575 Jev input tokens in the optimized
showcase (approximately $0.046 at the listed input rate), but did **not**
capture Groq L1 usage or cache hits. **No net cost advantage is established.**

Jev provider failures do not silently fall back to an LLM. Low-confidence
tool classifications escalate; failed parent/child alignment checks
escalate. The API response can optionally include model scores and usage
with `JEV_DIAGNOSTICS=true`, without including tool arguments or intention
text in that field. Audit explanations are deterministic descriptions of
Jev's labels and scores, **not** Jev-generated reasoning.
Before sending real tool context to OpenRouter/TypeSafe, review both
providers' data-handling and retention terms for the intended workload.

## September 2026 benchmark

The September 25 runs used isolated Intaris instances. The initial Groq and
Jev comparison ran on the same source revision; the optimized Jev variant
ran after the opt-in calibration code was added. All Jev arms used pinned
OpenRouter model `typesafe/jev-1.13-20260917`; `gpt-oss-20b` served as
the baseline L1 and benchmark agent, and `gpt-oss-120b` was the **same
independent scorer** for every showcase arm. Judge and L2/L3 analysis were
disabled to isolate L1. The [benchmark guide](benchmarking.md#jev-confidence-calibration)
documents the commands, configuration, and gold calibration report.

The nine scripted gold scenarios are the strongest *matched-call* comparison:

| Hand-labelled gold calls | Groq baseline | Original Jev, three questions | Jev, two questions | Jev, two questions + selective risk floor |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Benign approved | 24/26 | 18/26 in the first run; 17/26 on repeat | 21/26 | 23/26 |
| Benign denied or escalated | **2/26** | 8/26; 9/26 on repeat | 5/26 | **3/26** |
| Harmful blocked | 12/12 | 12/12 | 12/12 | 12/12 |
| Inherently dangerous directly denied | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |

One additional scripted call did not have a matching hand label and is not
included in those denominators. These are **single runs of a small, previously
seen set**, not proof of production safety or a statistically significant
margin. The original Jev repeat also shows outcome variability.
The two-axis variant sets `JEV_DECISION_QUESTION=false`; the selective
floor additionally sets `JEV_APPROVAL_RISK_CONFIDENCE=0.3`. All Jev arms
used `JEV_MINIMUM_CONFIDENCE=0.6`.

The 42-session showcase includes agent-generated calls, scored afterwards
by Groq `gpt-oss-120b`:

| Scorer metric | Groq baseline | Original Jev | Optimized Jev |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Precision | **0.957** | 0.663 | 0.765 |
| Recall | 0.800 | **0.953** | 0.878 |
| F1 | **0.871** | 0.782 | 0.818 |
| False-positive rate | **0.010** | 0.212 | 0.114 |
| Reported critical misses | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Scorer agreement on hand-labelled gold calls | 75.0% | 73.2% | 81.2% |
| L1 calls measured for latency | 162 | 130 | 143 |
| L1-only P95 latency | 791 ms | **430 ms** | 439 ms |

L1-only latency filters each run's saved `scenarios/*/calls.jsonl` records
to responses with `intaris.path == "llm"`, sorts their `latency_ms`, and
selects index `int(0.95 * (n - 1))`. It is **not** the all-call P95
reported in `evaluation.json`: that aggregate includes fast paths. The
scorer's gold-label agreement is below the benchmark's 95% reliability
target in all arms, so the showcase scores are especially tentative.

Run IDs: baseline `bench-20260925-1c01f1ed`, original Jev
`bench-20260925-fb6bded9`, optimized Jev
`bench-20260925-a9101fe7`. The local ignored `runs/` directories retain
full scenario reports on the benchmark machine; they are not committed.

**Interpret carefully:** each showcase arm generated a different sequence
and number of tool calls. Five scenarios in each arm failed due to
`gpt-oss-20b` benchmark-agent tool-generation errors. The scorer's labels
are not all hand-labelled ground truth, and the judge was disabled. Neither
the showcase F1 delta nor its zero reported critical misses establishes an
end-to-end production guarantee. These runs are also separate from the
previously published baseline benchmark in the project README.

## Current experiment and decision

The default Jev implementation asks separate alignment, risk, and
disposition questions and escalates if any answer fails the `0.6`
confidence floor. The first gold run's benign false blocks all resulted
from this compound threshold. The optional
`JEV_DECISION_QUESTION=false` variant asks only alignment and risk;
Intaris applies its existing decision policy. The additional, **opt-in**
`JEV_APPROVAL_RISK_CONFIDENCE=0.3` floor applies only when the call is
classified aligned and low/medium risk. Alignment and high/critical risk
keep the `0.6` floor. These settings reduced gold false blocks to 3/26
without a harmful gold approval, but the optimized showcase still had a
materially higher false-positive rate than Groq.

**Recommendation: keep `EVALUATOR_BACKEND=llm` in production.** Jev is
available for isolated, authenticated experiments only; do not enable the
optimized settings as a production default based on these runs.

Before reconsidering, replay the *same* newly labelled tool calls through
both evaluators, assess alignment false blocks and harmful approvals,
measure Groq L1 input/output/cache usage as well as Jev usage, repeat runs
to bound variance, and test the normal judge-enabled path. Require no
critical misses and a pre-agreed false-positive/latency/cost tradeoff.
